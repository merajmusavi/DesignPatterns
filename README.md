# Design Patterns in Kotlin and Java

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in both Kotlin and Java. Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are well-proven solutions used to solve specific problems in software development.

## Overview

Design patterns are categorized into three main types:
- **Creational Patterns**: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
- **Structural Patterns**: These patterns deal with object composition or the structure of classes.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: These patterns deal with object collaboration, responsibilities, and how objects interact with each other.

## Patterns Implemented

The following design patterns are implemented in this repository:

### Creational Patterns
1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype

### Structural Patterns
1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns
1. Chain of Responsibility
2. Command
3. Interpreter
4. Iterator
5. Mediator
6. Memento
7. Observer
8. State
9. Strategy
10. Template Method
11. Visitor

## Languages Used

Implementations are provided in two languages:

- **Kotlin**: Kotlin is a modern, concise, and statically typed programming language targeting the JVM, Android, JavaScript, and native code.
- **Java**: Java is a widely-used, high-level programming language known for its platform independence and versatility.

## Usage

Each design pattern is implemented in its own directory within the repository. You can navigate to the respective directory to view the implementation details in Kotlin and Java.

## Contribution

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you want to contribute a new design pattern implementation, please fork this repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing code style and conventions.
